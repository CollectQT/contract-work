# Contract for work on with CollectQT

## Summary

(TODO)

## The Details

(TODO)

### Version Control

(TODO)

### Project Management

(TODO)

### Completion of Work

(TODO)

The work will not be considered "done" until it

- has been tested to show that it will run successfully (which may require mocks and / or vcr)
- meets code linting / quality standards (ex: rubocop, flake8, code climate)
- has gone through no less than (2), and no more than (5), rounds of review by a representative of CollectQT

Any additional development needed beyond what is specified and implied in the original issue will be created as a new issue. CollectQT will not expand an issue partially through its completion, and will instead create a new issue that addresses the need to complete any further work.

### Payment

CollectQT will have all funds available for your payment to be released at any time during the course of your work. Signing this contract ensures that CollectQT will pay you in full for issues we accept your work on. The funds will be reserved from now from the moment someone representing CollectQT says "I formally accept (your name) for this contract" in the public repo, after you sign the contract.

The only thing that will prevent a release of funds is a break of the contract parameters on your part. A breach of contract on CollectQT's part will result result in you receiving the full payment regardless of any remaining conditions in the contract or any remaining work to be completed.

### Breach of Contract

Any activity or condition that constitutes a breach of contract will be communicated to you no less than (3) times by a representative of CollectQT. This communication will always involved the words "As specified in the contract", and make no attempt to confuse you as to its meaning. The contract will not be considered breached by any means unless a representative of CollectQT meets these minimum standards of communication.

### Legal

You and CollectQT agree not to hold each other liable for any damage to your hardware as a result of your work. The primarily applies to lost data due to mis-configured database settings, file paths, etc.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be removed from this agreement.

This contract will be hosted online and the hosted version will likely change over time. When this occurs, the new contract does NOT modify your active contract with CollectQT. The contract you signed (which you should keep a copy of) is the contract that applies to your work.

### Copyrights

Any work produced for CollectQT will be licensed either by [MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) or [AGPL](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-(agpl-3.0)). Both of these allow you to re-use the work, although AGPL states that you must disclose "your source code when you distribute, publish or serve modified or derivative software". The license of the project you are contributing to will be the one that applies to your work.

Further, using the work for your own promotion / portfolio / resume is explicitly exempted from the above licensing conditions. The most common case for this being: AGPL licensed work is exempt from the open source condition when it is used for your personal website.
