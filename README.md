# CollectQT Contract Work Repo

Contracts will be posted as individual [issues](https://github.com/CollectQT/contract-work/issues)

You can start working on an issue after a member of CollectQT approves work on it

## Getting To Work With Us

We do a short interview with people to confirm their skills and culture, but otherwise we are fairly flexible. Ping [@lynncyrin](https://twitter.com/lynncyrin) for details.

## Contract Process Notes

- turn markdown files to pdfs with [markdown2pdf](https://github.com/lynnco/markdown2pdf)
- sign pdfs with [hellosign](https://www.hellosign.com/)
- save the final signed pdf! (on google drive / etc)

## Github Workflow Notes

- Contractors get added to the CollectQT "workers" team, with write permissions but not admin permissions
- Any project a contractor works on should have branch protection on the default branch, which will require feature branches and PRs in order the merge their work
- PRs should have required status checks, primarily through [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/)
